<p>My first hackathon.. good old chainlink, around this time we were hearing a lot of tings on how the courtcase of the founders of tornado.cash was going,</p>
<p>After reading several documents/thigns about tornado-cash and their court hearings, i always wondered is there even a way to create a crosschain way of handling these deposits,</p>
<p>You could only deposit and withdraw on the same chain, a cross-chain vision was not really a possibility, while i had not even done any kind of check of how decentralized chainlink even truly is with their messaging i was already hooked up on this idea.</p>

<p>The idea was to store all the notes on ethereum as the main chain, this would mean that every token would need to have an ETH contract for the whole idea to work,(see image)</p>
<p>This would make it possible for every user, if there is liquidity to withdraw and deposit on each chain if their amount is avaliable, this means 1 pool 1 token any amount, what about the limit of the merkle tree? The limit would be something to worry about if we were in a situation in the past were each ETH tx would cost an extreme amount, but now it would be any worry but this would increase gas or maybe even stop working as the gas would be too much(Fusaka fork introduces a gas limit..), So this would be a bad thing but now it is not to worry,</p>
<p>While i had no knowledge if this would even work or not, i believed that i would be able to learn the required things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Circom</li>
<li>Snarkjs</li>
</ul>
<p>This was just before dear Cyfrin Updraft had released their course rebuilding the whole tornado cash system, but nonetheless opensource resources just like: <a href="https://github.com/nkrishang/tornado-cash-rebuilt/tree/main/test">https://github.com/nkrishang/tornado-cash-rebuilt/tree/main/test</a>
While i had a different idea attactched this still helped me out to learn and see, this was the first time i came across the scripting side in Foundry.</p>
<p>I went through videos and content (See github for the links), and finally overcame this by completing the project and also creating and having a frontend zkVerifier that can verify the ZKproofs, this was 7 months ago (EXCUSE ME FOR THE MIS USE OF TERMS),</p>
<p>But the frontend was able to verifiy the proof, with liquidity pools attached to it that created shares for the users, this was just a simple vault for to replenish any liquidity while i sadly had not thought about the scenario of wha thappens if the LP cant withdraw.</p>
<p>This hackathon ended with being one of the 5 winners of the chainlink Avalanche Track which netted me an amount of 1000 dollars, nice dime for a first timer.</p>
<p>But it really gave me some feedback/thoughts to consider next time, while i had learned a lot and given a lot on the project alone, i was pretty lackluster with the explanations i gave to the first time reader,</p>
<p>I failed to realize that judges and people reading it need to understand it without any prior knowledge, i just kept it veryy simple 200 word oen pager that gave information about what the project was,</p>
<p>The crypto native would maybe grasp the idea, but with some input from himself, THis was a wrong idea to go towards and to give, Which proablly resulted me into winnign 1 prize and maybe even sadly winning that price cuz of the privacy hackathon avalanche had&hellip; whcih i planned on participating in but did not.</p>

  Glass Perp Exchange (DID NOT SUBMIT)
  <a class="anchor" href="#glass-perp-exchange-did-not-submit">#</a>
</h3>
<p>My perfect idea was to create a perp exchange inspired by the likes of GMX, that created an enviorment for users to trade and be able to liquidate the user, i vagouly remember this protocol as i did not really put enough time into it and was very flustered by the idea of learning about perp exchanges and how they work (Checked out several from GMX to HL).</p>
<p>THis was not the best experience, but the lessons were there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create with a vision/plan.</li>
<li>Give everything up to finish and win.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading" id="hyperbot-hyperliquid-hackathon-disaster-did-not-submit-again">
  Hyperbot (Hyperliquid hackathon) (DISASTER, did NOT SUBMIT AGAIN!!)
  <a class="anchor" href="#hyperbot-hyperliquid-hackathon-disaster-did-not-submit-again">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The idea here was to create a full trading bot through twitter in 30 days (I already started 7+ days later cause of the 1inch hackathon before^), this would allow users to trade and fully engage through hyperbot, whihc would provide a full on trading experience via twitter,</p>
<p>This caused me to stumble on the language golang, which i have seen /come across in some 1inch repo before, but did not really know what it trully represented(Knew it was a backend language like Rust).</p>
<p>i dove into golang and the basics were really similiar but this would to lose some time as i really wanted to understand what i wrote down in my vscode, but the time was thiking, never having interacted with any API(Twitter in this case), caused me to stress and learn about HTTP, i did not even really understand what kind of things we wanted to expected.</p>
<p>After learning how to do a request i had a tons of errors with hyperliquid and gave up the last few days due errors and not having enoguh time to fully implement a working example for the hackathons.</p>

<p>My last 2 hackathons were in a team which i have never really done, which learned me some valuable things on how to manage repo&rsquo;s and manage tasks in a collabrative manner.</p>
