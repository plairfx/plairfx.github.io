      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my web3 journey through Cyfrin Updraft, which first&#xA;started me by learning some javascript/solidity. This introducted me&#xA;to a concept i have not really seen which was auditing and getting money!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While i understood the basics web3 security and gotten some basic findings in audit contests,&#xA;i never really enjoyed it/felt attracted doing it every single day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That finally changed  with choosing to go build things instead of auditing them.&#xA;Which brings me to this present moment building and learning with languages&#xA;such as Solidity, Golang which brings out something more&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
