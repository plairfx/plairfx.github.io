I started my web3 journey through Cyfrin Updraft, which first 
started me by learning some javascript/solidity. This introducted me
to a concept i have not really seen which was auditing and getting money!

While i understood the basics web3 security and gotten some basic findings in audit contests, 
i never really enjoyed it/felt attracted doing it every single day.

That finally changed  with choosing to go build things instead of auditing them. 
Which brings me to this present moment building and learning with languages
such as Solidity, Golang which brings out something more...
